# LogisticRegressionModel
Logistic Regression model is build using python- numpy, in which back propagation is used to find the parameters 

This model was build using python library numpy to vectorize the train and test set, gradient descent was applied to train the parameters of the model.

This is an example of backpropogation and forward propagation in action, as parameter are found using backpropagation and again the model is build using those newly found parametes.
