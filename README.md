# LogisticRegressionModel
Logistic Regression model is build using python- numpy, in which back propagation is used to find the parameters 

This model was build using python library numpy to vectorize the train and test set, gradient descent was applied to train the parameters of the model.

This is an example of backpropogation and forward propagation in action, as parameter are found using backpropagation and again the model is build using those newly found parametes. 

Here the dataset contains the images of flowers and other images which are not of flower , for flower it is 1 and for non-flower we have given 0.

The task is to predict if the image is of flower or not. 

Each image is of 64*64*3 matrix.
